Theos Examples
==============

This repo is for simple example projects with theos. They are not intended to be advanced tutorials, but rather simple programs to showcase some of the things you can do and the techniques thereof. Currenty, there are 5 example projects in this repo. Most, if not all of them are totally useless, are are solely intended to be learning excercises. As of now, they are:

 - UnlockChanger, which changes the 'slide to unlock' text.
 - RespringNotifier, which displays a notification on respring.
 - CallNow, which allows you to assign an activator gesture to call a specified number.
 - NameChanger, which allow you to change app's names to a specified name. //NOT READY
 - PassChanger, which changes the 'Enter Passcode' text to an incorrectly entered passcode.

These example programs were all written and annotated by me, Phillip Tennen, (a.k.a. Codyd51), so it's very possible that I missed something, or coded something wrong, or made a mistake in my annotations. If any mistakes are found or you have any improvements to offer to this, for lack of a better word, tutorial series, please let me know.
